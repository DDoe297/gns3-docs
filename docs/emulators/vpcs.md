Virtual PC Simulator is a program written by Paul Meng, which allows you to simulate a lightweight PC supporting DHCP and ping. It consumes only 2MB of RAM per instance,  and does not require an additional image.

The official website:
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/vpcs/?source=directory](https://github.com/GNS3/vpcs )

## Put a VPCS node your topology

The VPCS node is included with GNS3 by default.  No additional configuration is required. It will be located in the End devices category in the Devices list:

<img alt="screenshot" src={useBaseUrl('img/emulators/vpcs/1.jpg')} />

Drag and drop an instance of VPCS into the workspace. You’ll be prompted which server type will run this VPCS instance:

<img alt="screenshot" src={useBaseUrl('img/emulators/vpcs/2.jpg')} />

(for this article, “GNS3 VM” was selected for the server type)
An instance of VPCS will now appear in the workspace:

<img alt="screenshot" src={useBaseUrl('img/emulators/vpcs/3.jpg')} />

After you start the VPCS node, you can access its console:

```

## Set an IP
### Manually set an IP

```
PC1> ip 192.168.1.1
Checking for duplicate address...
PC1 : 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
```

### Use DHCP
```
PC1> dhcp
```

## Ping & Traceroute
```
PC1> ping 192.168.1.2

## Save Configuration
The configured IP address will be lost on restart, if you don’t save the config:

```
PC1> save

## Limitations

VPCS is a PC simulator. Its implementation of the network stack is not perfect, and you will see bugs when it’s used in complex topologies.

Use of the ipterm docker container is a viable alternative to using VPCS. The ipterm container will require use of linux commands, as well as running it via the GNS3 VM for Windows/Mac OS X users.  Linux users can run it natively, provided docker-ce has been installed, and their user was added to the docker group (restarting your user session after adding your user to that group is required).
